Let's review how to add an IP into CRM.

Navigate to the IP & Products module. 
Press Add New IP and fill in the form on screen. 

Required fields include Licensor — press the Add button to select a Licensor from the list, then press Done. 
Another required field is Intellectual Property Primary ID, which can match your Intellectual Property name or be different. 
Finally, required is the IP Type — press Add to select the IP type, then press Done. 
All other fields are optional. 
Press Save.

After saving your IP, you can add an image by pressing the Plus button, selecting Choose File, picking the file from your drive, and pressing Go. 
Once complete, you can close this screen. 

You have now successfully added an IP to CRM. 
The new IP will appear as an option when adding IPs within a contract for the selected licensor.

CRM also offers a template upload function as an alternative way to load IPs and IP groups into the system. 
To use this feature, download the IP Upload Template from the Help section, fill in the template, then navigate to IP & Products → IP Find/View → IP Upload. 
Here, you can upload your completed template. 

For more information, reference the IP Upload Help document located in the Help section of CRM.

If you need extra information, press the Help button in the top right corner of your screen. 
This opens all available Help Guides, which you can search for what you need. 
For further assistance, contact your administrator.

Thank you and have a great day.

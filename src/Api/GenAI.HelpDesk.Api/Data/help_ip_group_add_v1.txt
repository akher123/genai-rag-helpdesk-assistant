Let's review how to add an IP Group into CRM.

Creating an IP Group allows you to group multiple IPs together, making it faster and easier to add them to contracts.

Navigate to the IP & Products module. 
Select IP Find/View, then select IP Hierarchy. 
Press Add New IP Group. 
In the new window, fill out the form. 
Required fields include Licensor — press the Add button to select a licensor from the list, then press Done. 
The other required field is the IP Group Name. 
All other fields and tabs are optional. 
Press Save.

To verify your new group, search for it by selecting Search by IP Group Name and typing the group name. 
Press the magnifying glass icon to bring up your IP Group on screen.

Press the pencil button to edit the group, then navigate to the Components tab to add individual IPs into the group you created. 
Please note that individual IPs must already exist in the system before they can be added to a group.

Press Assign IPs to Selected IP Group. 
Select the IPs that should be added by checking them off, then press Add IPs. 
Return to the Components tab to see the IPs you added listed in the table. 
To delete an IP, press the X button. 
Once finished, press Save.

CRM also offers a template upload function as an alternative way to load IPs and IP groups into the system. 
To use this feature, download the IP Upload Template from the Help section in CRM. 
Fill in the template, then navigate to IP & Product → IP Find/View → IP Upload. 
Here, you can upload your completed template.

For more information, reference the IP Upload Help document located in the Help section of CRM.

If you need additional information, press the Help button in the top right corner of your screen. 
This opens all Help Guides, which you can search for what you need. 
For further assistance, contact your administrator.

Thank you and have a great day.

Let's review how to manually add a new Product String into the CRM system.

Product strings contain a four-level hierarchy from largest to smallest: product, category, subcategory, and article. 
In this example, we will add an entirely new product string hierarchy. 
You can also add to an existing product string at any level.

To begin, create the Product Level. 
Navigate to the IP & Products module. 
Select the Product tab, then choose "Add New Product" from the submenu. 
A new form appears. 
Fill in all required fields, including the Product Name. 
All other fields are optional. 
Check with your administrator if you need to use these fields. 
Press Save.

Next, create the Category Level. 
Select Product Categories from the submenu and press Add New. 
A new form appears. 
Fill in all required fields, including Category Name. 
Check the "Show All Products" box to bring up a list of all products. 
Check off all products that the category falls under. 
Press Save.

Now create the Subcategory Level. 
Select Product Subcategories from the submenu and press Add New. 
A new form appears. 
Fill in all required fields, including Subcategory Name. 
Check the "Show All Categories" box and select all categories that the subcategory falls under. 
Categories also display their related product selections next to them. 
All other fields are optional. 
Press Save.

Finally, create the Article Level. 
Select Product Articles from the submenu and press Add New. 
A new form appears. 
Fill in all required fields, including Article Name. 
Check the "Show All Subcategories" box and select all subcategories that the article falls under. 
Both the category and product category will be listed next to them. 
Press Save.

To edit a listing at any product hierarchy level, click the pencil button. 
To view a full existing product hierarchy, navigate to the Product Hierarchy tab in the submenu. 
Find the product you are looking for and expand it to view all hierarchy levels.

CRM also offers a Product String Template Upload function as an alternative way to load product strings into the system. 
To use this feature, download the Product String Upload Template from the Help section in CRM. 
Fill in the template, then navigate to IP & Products → Product → Upload Product String. 
Here, you can upload your completed template.

For more details about template upload, refer to the Product String Upload Help document located in the CRM Help section.

If you need additional information, press the Help button in the top right corner of your screen. 
This opens all available Help Guides, which you can search through. 
For further assistance, contact your administrator.

Thank you and have a great day.

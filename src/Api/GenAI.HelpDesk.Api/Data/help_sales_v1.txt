How Upload Sales Reports are also called Income Statements?

Let's go over how to fill in a standard DRM Sales Report Template, which can later be uploaded into the DRM system. 
In CRM, Sales Reports are also called Income Statements. 

Please note that these templates can be customized, so your specific template may look different from what is shown here. 
Contact your system administrator for a copy of your specific template and to understand which fields are required and which are optional. 

Let's review the Standard Template. 
On the screen, you can see an Excel sheet with column headings. 
The headers in yellow are mandatory required fields. 
The columns in this template must be kept in the same order you received them. 

The first column is Transaction Date. 
Enter the date when the transaction occurred. 
Use two digits for the month, two digits for the day, and four digits for the year. 
The date order depends on the format you have selected in the system.

The next column is Transaction Type. 
Enter one of the following types: Sale, Return, FOB Sale, FOB Return, Other Positive, Other Negative, or Promo. 
Contact your system administrator if you are unsure which one to use.

The next column is SKU. 
Enter the SKU number or alternate SKU number for the item that was sold. 
The SKU should match what was used when you submitted the item for approval. 
Double-check for accurate reporting of the SKU number.

The next column is Territory. 
Enter the country where the transaction occurred.

The next column is Sales Channel. 
Enter the sales channel where the transaction occurred. 
Examples include Mass Market or Closeout. 
This field cannot be left blank. 
If not defined, add N/A.

The next column is Market. 
Enter the market as the retailer where the transaction took place, such as Target or Marshalls. 
This field cannot be left blank. 
If not defined, add N/A.

The next column is Units. 
Enter the number of units sold or the number of units returned. 
Never enter a negative number. 
The system will automatically deduct based on the transaction type entered.

The next columns are Suggested Retail Price, Wholesale, and Other Price. 
These fields are optional. 
You can enter the price per unit, but use only one of these columns based on the transaction and rate type you are using.

The next column is Sales Amount. 
Enter the total amount of sales or returns. 
Do not enter a negative number. 
The system will know to deduct based on the transaction type you’ve entered.

The next column is Rate. 
Enter the royalty rate that should be applied to this line. 
Enter only the number. 
For example, if the rate is 10%, enter 10.

The next column is Rate Type. 
Enter the rate type based on the terms of your agreement, such as percent of net sales. 
It must be entered exactly as it appears in the system.

The last column is Royalty Amount. 
Enter the total royalty amount due here. 
Do not enter a negative number. 
The system will know to deduct based on the transaction type you’ve chosen.

Once all required columns have been filled out for each row of transaction data, you are ready to upload the report to CRM. 
You can find another Help Video on how to upload the sales report into CRM.
